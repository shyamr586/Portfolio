         development of the IT sector and the many sub-sectors that are branching ever so frequently,\
        my interest in the field also advanced. After writing my very first script using Python 2.7, I\
         realized that I had an interest in the field and was very eager to learn more about the attainable\
         progress. I constantly observe the requirements put forward by the industry to see what skills\
         are desired and give my best effort to keep up with the standards. \n\nI come across my colleagues as an\
         honest and hard-working individual who would always be punctual and trustworthy."
